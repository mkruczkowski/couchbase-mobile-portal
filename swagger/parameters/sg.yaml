        type: string
      channels:
        description: A comma-separated list of channel names. The response will be filtered to only documents in these channels. (This parameter must be used with the sync_gateway/bychannel filter parameter; see below.)

        type: integer
      heartbeat:
        description: Default is 0. Interval in milliseconds at which an empty line (CRLF) is written to the response. This helps prevent gateways from deciding the socket is idle and closing it. Only applicable to longpoll or continuous feeds. Overrides any timeout to keep the feed alive indefinitely. Setting to 0 results in no heartbeat.
        type: integer
        default: 0
      timeout:
