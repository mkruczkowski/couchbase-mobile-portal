    description: |
      This request returns any number of documents, as individual bodies in a MIME multipart response.
      Each enclosed body contains one requested document. The bodies appear in the same order as in the request, but can also be identified by their X-Doc-ID and X-Rev-ID headers.
      A body for a document with no attachments will have content type application/json and contain the document itself.
      A body for a document that has attachments will be written as a nested multipart/related body. Its first part will be the document's JSON, and the subsequent parts will be the attachments (each identified by a Content-Disposition header giving its attachment name.)
    parameters:
      - $ref: '#/parameters/revs'
      - $ref: '#/parameters/revs_limit'

      This request retrieves a sorted list of changes made to documents in the database, in time order of application. Each document appears at most once, ordered by its most recent change, regardless of how many times it's been changed.
      This request can be used to listen for update and modifications to the database for post processing or synchronization. A continuously connected changes feed is a reasonable approach for generating a real-time log for most applications.

      This request creates a new document or creates a new revision of an existing document. It enables you to specify the identifier for a new document rather than letting the software create an identifier. If you want to create a new document and let the software create an identifier, use the POST /db request.
      If the document specified by doc does not exist, a new document is created and assigned the identifier specified in doc. If the document already exists, the document is updated with the JSON document in the message body and given a new revision.
