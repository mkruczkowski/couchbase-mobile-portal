Document:
  type: object
  properties:
    _id:
      type: string
      description: The document ID.
    _rev:
      type: string
      description: Revision identifier of the parent revision the new one should replace. (Not used when creating a new document.)
    _exp:
      type: string
      description: Expiry time. The expiration time is set and managed on the Couchbase Server document (TTL is not supported for databases in walrus mode). The value can be specified in two ways; in ISO-8601 format, for example the 6th of July 2016 at 17:00 in the BST timezone would be 2016-07-06T17:00:00+01:00; it can also be specified as a numeric Couchbase Server expiry value. Couchbase Server expiries are specified as Unix time, and if the desired TTL is below 30 days then it can also represent an interval in seconds from the current time (for example, a value of 5 will remove the document 5 seconds after it is written to Couchbase Server). The document expiration time is returned in the response of GET /{db}/{doc} when show_exp=true is included in the querystring. Document expiry values are not included in replication.
