    <description>This guide documents Model objects, which allow you to create an application object model that bridges to Couchbase Lite documents. [Objective-C only]</description>
    <introduction>
        <paragraph>Most applications use the Model/View/Controller design pattern to separate user interface and user interaction from underlying data structures and logic. Of course, one of the responsibilities of the app's object model is persistence.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Couchbase Lite on iOS provides support for creating model objects that persist to Couchbase Lite documents, and can be queried using Couchbase Lite queries. (This functionality is similar to Core Data's NSManagedObject.) You subclass the abstract class CBLModel and add your own Objective-C properties, plus a very small amount of annotation that defines how those properties map to JSON in the document.</paragraph>
        <note>Model objects are currently only available in Objective-C. They may be added to the other implementations in the future, although the property-related features may be different in order to fit in with those platforms' idioms.</note>

            <title>Defining model classes</title>
            <body>
                <paragraph>To create your own model class, just make it inherit from CBLModel. You can create any number of model classes, and they can inherit from each other. Each model class will correspond to a different type of persistent entity in your application.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>You define persistent properties of your model classes simply by declaring Objective-C properties in its <code>@interface</code> block using the <code>@property</code> syntax. To mark a property as persistent, in the <code>@implementation</code> block you must declare it as being <code>@dynamic</code>, as shown in the next example.</paragraph>
                <note type="caution">If you forget to declare a persistent property as <code>@dynamic</code>, the compiler will automatically synthesize a regular instance variable with getter/setter methods, so your program will compile and will appear to work except that the property won't be persistently saved to the document. This can be hard to debug! You can have the compiler flag missing <code>@dynamic</code> declarations by enabling the "Implicit Synthesized Properties" warning in the Xcode target build settings, but if you do this you'll also need to explicitly use <code>@synthesize</code> declarations for all synthesized properties.</note>
                <paragraph>Here's the declaration of a simple model class for a to-do list item:</paragraph>

                <paragraph>CBLModel supports a pretty broad range of data types for properties, but not everything goes, and some types require special handling. Types that can't be directly represented in JSON — like dates — will be converted to a string representation, but will be properly converted back to the property's native type when the model object is next read from the database.</paragraph>

                        <description><code>CBLJSONEncoding</code> is an Objective-C protocol defined by Couchbase Lite. Any class of yours that implements this protocol can be used as the type of a persistent property; CBLModel will call the CBLJSONEncoding API to tell the object to convert itself to/from JSON.</description>
                    </entry>
                </description-list>
                <note>If an object-valued property has a value of <code>nil</code>, its corresponding JSON property will be left out entirely when saving the document; it will <emphasis>not</emphasis> be written with a JSON <code>null</code> as a value. Similarly, any missing property in the JSON will be converted to a nil or 0 or false value in Objective-C.</note>
                <note>If a JSON value read from a document has a type that's incompatible with the corresponding model property — like a string when the property type is <code>int</code> — the model property will be set to the appropriate empty value (<code>0</code>, <code>false</code>, or <code>nil</code>). If you need stricter type matching, you should add a validation function to the Database, to ensure that documents have the correct JSON property types.</note>

                <body>
                    <paragraph>The <code>NSArray</code> property type often needs special handling, to ensure that the items of JSON arrays are converted to the correct type of object. By default, the items are simply parsed as JSON; this breaks round-trip fidelity if you store NSDate or NSData or CBLModel objects -- they'll all be read back in as NSStrings. And if you store objects implementing CBLJSONEncoding, they'll be read back in as whatever JSON-compatible value the object encoded itself as.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>To prevent this, you can specify that the items of the array property must be of a particular class. Each item will then be converted from JSON according to the property-type rules for that class, described in the previous section. To specify the type, implement a class method with a name of the form <emphasis>propertyname</emphasis>ItemClass, as in this example:</paragraph>

                    <body>
                        <paragraph>There's one limitation of the default mechanism of instantiating model objects: you have to know what class the model object will be before you instantiate it, since you call <code>+modelForDocument:</code> on that specific class. This can be a problem if you have a hierarchy of model classes, and want to instantiate different subclasses for different types of documents.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For example, let's say you have a fancy to-do list that supports not just text notes but voice notes and picture notes. You've created <code>VoiceNote</code> and <code>PictureNote</code> subclasses of <code>Note</code> for these, and the documents in the database follow the convention of using a <code>"type"</code> property to identify their type, with values <code>"note"</code>, <code>"voice_note"</code> and <code>"picture_note"</code>. Now, any time you want to instantiate a model object, it seems you'll first have to look at the document's <code>"type"</code> property, match the value to a <code>Note</code> class, and instantiate that class:</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Even worse, let's say you have a model class that has a reference to a Note, i.e. a property of type <code>Note*</code>. When resolving this property value, CBLModel will instantiate a <code>Note</code> object, even if the document's type indicates it should be represented by a <code>VoiceNote</code> or <code>PictureNote</code>!</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To solve these problems, register your model classes with the database's ModelFactory, specifying a different <code>"type"</code> value for each one:</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>This doesn't look much different from the usual style; but by letting CBLModel choose the class, you'll dynamically get an object of the correct subclass (Note, VoiceNote or PictureNote) based on the <code>"type"</code> property of the individual document. Also, when resolving a property value whose type is a model class, the factory will be used to ensure that the correct subclass is instantiated.</paragraph>
                        <note>For this to work, you do have to make sure your model object sets the document's <code>"type"</code> property appropriately!</note>
