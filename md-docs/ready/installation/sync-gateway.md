## Instance from AWS marketplace

1. Browse to the [Sync Gateway AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B013XDO1B4) in the AWS Marketplace.
2. Click Continue.
3. Change all ports to "MY IP" except for port 4984.
4. Make sure you choose a key that you have locally.

### SSH in and start Sync Gateway

1. Go to the AWS console, find the EC2 instance, and find the instance's public ip address. It should look like `ec2-54-161-201-224.compute-1.amazonaws.com`. The rest of the instructions will refer to this as `public_ip`.
2. From the command line, run `ssh ec2-user@public_ip` (this should let you in without prompting you for a password. If not, you chose a key when you launched that you donâ€™t have locally).
3. Start the Sync Gateway with this command.

    ```bash
    /opt/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin/sync_gateway -interface=0.0.0.0:4984 -url=http://localhost:8091 -bucket=sync_gateway -dbname=sync_gateway
    ```

4. You should see output like this:

    ```

### Verify via curl

From your workstation:

```bash
$ curl http://public_ip:4984/sync_gateway/
```
You should get a response like the following:

```bash
{"committed_update_seq":1,"compact_running":false,"db_name":"sync_gateway","disk_format_version":0,"instance_start_time":1446579479331843,"purge_seq":0,"update_seq":1}
```

### Customize configuration

For more advanced Sync Gateway configuration, you will want to create a JSON config file on the EC2 instance itself and pass that to Sync Gateway when you launch it, or host your config JSON on the internet somewhere and pass Sync Gateway the URL to the file.

### View Couchbase Server UI

In order to login to the Couchbase Server UI, go to `http://public_ip:8091` and use the following credentials:

**Username**: Administrator

**Password**: The AWS instance id that can be found on the EC2 Control Panel (eg: i-8a9f8335)
