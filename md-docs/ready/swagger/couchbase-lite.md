The API explorer below groups all the endpoints by functionality. You can click on a label to expand the list of endpoints. For each endpoint, the **Try it out** button can be used to generate the request using curl.

### API Explorer

{% include swagger.html name="couchbase-lite" %}

### Try it out

The Couchbase Lite REST API does not support CORS. The **Try it out** button can therefore be used to generate curl commands but the request won't succeed from the web browser.
